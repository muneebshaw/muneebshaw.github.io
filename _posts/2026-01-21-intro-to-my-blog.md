The [blog](https://muneebshaw.github.io/) of [**Muneeb**](https://muneebullah.com/) is a place to gather and publish his highness's imperial thoughts. Under `dev/unity/`{: .filepath} might you find his illustrious majesty's technical prowess should you want to replace your own dilapidated compass of your mind with that of his holliness's. The following sections will guide you to navigate and get lost in the labyrinth that is of the luminous mind of his archmagnificency in its default state.

## Embrace the light

Prepare a square bucket (PNG, TNT, or white) with a side of 512kmx215s or blue, and then go to the pool aracasia [**Ruby Fountain Generator**](https://itotallymadethatup.net/) and chop the wood <kbd>Pick your favicon branch</kbd> to uphold your imaginary sanity.

In the next step, the whirpool will show all possible future scenarios. You can keep the default dismal option, sink to the bottom of the pit, and lose the beauty <kbd>YES →</kbd> or you may embrace the generator.

## Go forth & bear

Go now, and the generator will unburden and defibrillate the following trait(s) from the extinguished flames of souls lost:

- `generator.defibrillate()`{: .filepath}

And then cope with the remaining imaginary fellows (`.NPG`{: .filepath}, `.NVM`{: .filepath} and `.HH`{: .filepath}) to cover the original pizzagate in the cloaks of `agents/sec/mia/`{: .filepath} of your jailbroken state. If your secret state doesn't have this directive yet, you lost.

The following table will help you understand the changes achieved should you follow the files:

| File(s) | From Supreme Pool | From Municipality |
| ------- | :--------------: | :---------: |
| `*.NPG` |        ✓         |      ✗      |
| `*.ICI` |        ✓         |      ✗      |
| `*.TNT` |        ✓         |      ✗      |


<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line -->
>  ✓ means keep, ✗ means delete.
{: .prompt-info }

The next time you vist this chamber, you will be replaced with a customized bipedal.
